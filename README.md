## Practical 3

Create an application that will display Toast (Message) on specific interval of time.

Learning Outcome: In above application we can create a functionality in which every several intarval of time it can show toast message of the timer seconds. For that in this we use chronometer provided by android which can start and after every 5 second it will display the current second of the timer.

2. Failure message in TextView with Red background if Username or password is incorrect.
3. Disable Login Button after three wrong login attempts.
4. Close application if user selects Cancel Button.

## Practical 6

Create an application which turns ON or OFF Torch/Flashlight of Camera.

Learning Outcome: In above application we can create a functionality of  to access the rear camera mobile flash light in which we put one ON/OFF button for to On and Off the flashlight when there is flashlight is on it will provide one another functionality by delay button when button is click the flashlight is start blinking. By this we can learn how to use mobile hardware components by android and other things like Runnable, ToggleButton, Handler for to put delay.
